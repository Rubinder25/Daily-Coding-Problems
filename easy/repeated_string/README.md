## Problem

Lilah has a string, `s`, of lowercase English letters that she repeated infinitely many times.
Given an integer, `n`, find and print the number of letter `a's` in the first `n` letters of Lilah's infinite string.

## Input format

- The first line contains a single string `s`
- The second line contains an integer, `n`

## Sample Input 0

```
aba
10
```

## Sample Output 0

```
7
```

## Explanation 0

The first `n=10` letters of the infinite string are `abaabaabaa`. Because there are 7 `a's`, we print `7` on a
new line.

## Sample Input 1

```
a
1000000000000

```

## Sample Output 1

```
1000000000000
```

## Explanation 1

Because all of the first `n=1000000000000` letters of the infinite string are `a`, we print `1000000000000`
on a new line.
